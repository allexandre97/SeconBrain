# TSS, AWH, and OPES as Adaptive Free-Energy Methods

## Short answer

TSS is closest to AWH in that both are adaptive extended-ensemble methods over a discrete or discretized parameter, but TSS is framed more explicitly as an on-the-fly free-energy estimator plus adaptive resource-allocation scheme. AWH learns a bias from conditional weight histograms so the sampled parameter follows a target distribution. OPES is different: it reconstructs a collective-variable probability density on the fly and derives a bias from that reconstructed density. [SRC-0005, sections 2.1-2.2] [SRC-0007, section II] [SRC-0008, section II.A] [SRC-0010, eqs. 4-8]

In practical terms, TSS is the most estimator-centric of the three, AWH is the most mature extended-ensemble bias-learning comparison point in the wiki, and OPES is the most CV-probability-reconstruction oriented.

## Detailed answer

All three methods use samples collected during a run to change the future run. They differ in what is being learned and what adaptation is supposed to accomplish.

TSS estimates free energies across rungs $\lambda_k$ using stochastic approximation. Its update maintains free-energy estimates $F$, auxiliary observable estimates $\mu$, and visit-control tilts $o$. The tilts drive transient sampling toward under-visited rungs, while the asymptotic target remains the desired rung allocation. [SRC-0005, eqs. 7-8 and 24-26] [SRC-0005, section 2.2.1] TSS also includes a windowed construction for large rung spaces: overlapping local TSS problems are stitched into global sampling and reporting quantities. [SRC-0005, section 3.1] [SRC-0006, sections 6-7]

AWH also promotes a parameter $\lambda$ to a sampled variable and learns free-energy weights during the simulation. Its distinctive mechanism is the weight histogram: each configuration contributes fractional conditional probabilities $P(\lambda \mid x)$ to many parameter values, and the free-energy bias is updated by comparing that accumulated conditional-weight histogram with a target distribution. [SRC-0007, eqs. 5 and 7] [SRC-0009, eqs. 3 and 5] This makes AWH a close conceptual neighbor to TSS, especially for alchemical or umbrella-style parameter spaces.

OPES adapts a bias in collective-variable space rather than primarily over a ladder of thermodynamic rungs. It estimates the unbiased CV probability density $P(s)$ with weighted Gaussian kernels and constructs a bias from the ratio between that estimate and a chosen target distribution. [SRC-0010, eqs. 4-5] Its regularization parameter bounds the bias, and kernel compression keeps the KDE representation practical. [SRC-0010, eq. 8] [SRC-0011]

The main comparison is therefore:

| Aspect | TSS | AWH | OPES |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adaptive object | Free-energy estimates, auxiliary averages, and visit-control tilts over rungs | Free-energy bias from a conditional weight histogram | CV probability estimate and derived bias |
| Sampling space | Simulated-tempering-style rung space, optionally windowed | Extended ensemble over $\lambda$ or umbrella centers | Collective-variable space $s(R)$ |
| Core adaptation goal | Estimate free energies while reallocating effort toward useful or under-visited rungs | Make the sampled parameter marginal match a target distribution | Sample a target CV distribution by reconstructing probability on the fly |
| Scaling mechanism | Overlapping windows and stitched local free-energy estimates | Gibbs parameter moves, target distributions, and multiwalker workflows | Kernel compression and bounded bias regularization |
| Main caveat | Promising theory and focused tests, not broad validation | Stronger validation history, but not universally better than BAR/MBAR | Still limited by CV and target-distribution choice |

TSS's distinctive claim is not merely that it updates a bias, but that estimator information changes future sample allocation. The wiki records a TSS result where, under the paper's assumptions, adaptive on-the-fly sampling can have lower asymptotic variance than MBAR for free-energy differences. [SRC-0005, proposition 3] [SRC-0006, section 4.5] That should not be generalized to "TSS beats AWH or OPES"; the durable validation-scope note explicitly treats TSS as promising but not universally validated. [SRC-0005, section 4] [SRC-0006, section 10]

AWH has a broader method-development and demonstration trail in the wiki: model systems, atomistic PMFs, and alchemical hydration free energies. [SRC-0007] [SRC-0008] [SRC-0009] It is a more established baseline for adaptive extended-ensemble molecular free-energy work, but its own source notes caution that it should not be expected to dominate BAR/MBAR when intermediate-state sampling is already efficient. [SRC-0009, conclusion]

OPES should be compared less as a direct free-energy-ladder estimator and more as a metadynamics-adjacent enhanced-sampling strategy. It can produce free-energy surfaces in CV space by reconstructing probability distributions, but its effectiveness depends heavily on the selected collective variables and target distribution. [SRC-0010]

## Key equations

TSS visit-control density: [SRC-0005, eqs. 11 and 15]

$$
\pi_k^{TSS}=\frac{\gamma_k o_k^{-\eta}}{\sum_\ell \gamma_\ell o_\ell^{-\eta}}.
$$

AWH conditional weight: [SRC-0009, eq. 3]

$$
w_\lambda(x)=
\frac{\pi_\lambda e^{f_\lambda-\beta E_\lambda(x)}}{\sum_{\lambda'}\pi_{\lambda'}e^{f_{\lambda'}-\beta E_{\lambda'}(x)}}.
$$

OPES bias: [SRC-0010, eq. 8]

$$
V_n(s)=\left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)\frac{1}{\beta}
\log\left(\frac{\tilde{P}_n(s)}{Z_n}+\epsilon\right).
$$

## Wiki updates made

- Added a TSS/AWH/OPES comparison section to [[wiki/concepts/adaptive-enhanced-sampling]].

## Remaining gaps

- The wiki does not yet contain a direct head-to-head benchmark of TSS against AWH or OPES on the same molecular system.
- The comparison is therefore conceptual and provenance-limited, not a ranking of production performance.
